    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris">Tetris</a> is a classical video game.
    Figures are game pieces that have geometric shapes composed of four or more square blocks each.
    A random sequence of figures fall down the playing field (a rectangular vertical shaft ).
    The objective of the game is to manipulate these Figures,
    by moving each one sideways and rotating it by 90 degree units, with the aim of
    creating a horizontal line of ten blocks without gaps.
    When such a line is created, it disappears, and any block above the deleted line will fall.
    When a certain number of lines are cleared, the game enters a new level.
    As the game progresses, each level adds new more complex figures and
    the game ends when the stack of figures reaches the top of the playing
    field and no new figure are able to enter.

    For each step your function get an information about the current figure, the next figure,
    a map of the field and current level. Figures represented as a binary matrix,
    where 1 is filled and 0 is empty square. Figures doesn't have spare empty lines or columns.
    The game field is represented as a binary matrix 10 by 10, where 1 is filled and 0 is empty square.
    Level information is a number.

    For each step you should return a sequence of actions which will be used before dropping.
    You can move a figure at left ("L") or right ("R"). If you need move it at several cells - use
    several letters: "RRR" - move a figure at 3 cell right.
    Nad you can rotate by clockwise ("C") and counterclockwise ("A").
    A figure are aligned by left own edge after rotation.
    The order of actions doesn't matter, because rotations are applying first, then moving and
    dropping the last automatically. Left and right moves are accumulated 
    (for example: "LLLLLLRR" == "LLLL")
    Figures appear at the 5th column (index 4). It means that the first column of the figure is the
    fifth on the field. So if you want to press a figure to left wall, you need "LLLL".

<p>
    Score that are gained by cleared lines related to level and how many lines were burned in one
    move. Levels increased by each 50 burned lines.
</p>
<pre>
score += (burned_lines * 20 - 10) * (1 + level * 0.2)
</pre>
